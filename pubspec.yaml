    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Poppins
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Black.ttf
                weight: 900
              - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-BlackItalic.ttf
                weight: 900
                style: italic
              - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
                weight: 700
